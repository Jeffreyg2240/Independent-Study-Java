### Week 8:

During week 8, I was able to download Wei’s files and start working on the main project. I was able to fix the pokemon’s movement so that it doesn’t just slide in one direction infinitely. Thus I was able to fix Wei’s animation bug, where the sprite will also return facing right after the key is released. Keeping the animation facing the direction of its movement wasn’t hard, but getting the animation to play and stop without facing another direction was hard to program. After a lot of testing, I was able to get the pokemon to move smoothly.

Our next step is to create the bomb and its animations. Johnson is currently working on implementing the music, while I and Wei work towards an MVP for the project.

#### Takeaways:
**Take breaks while working, but not for too long.** If you spend too much time on the project, you’ll be too drawn into the code to zoom out. This is helpful especially when it comes to debugging, it helps me reset my mind to keep focus for a longer time, thus this can this be beneficial to your health in a office job.

Although taking a long break could cause a “blank” where you forget about what you were doing cause you to waste more time and effort to get back on pace to where you were before the break. 

*I found highlighting the code that I was working on before leaving helps me refresh my memory to what I was trying to debug.*
